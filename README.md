# SADEA-algorithm-MATLAB-using-ooDACE-toolbox

This repository uses MATLAB to complete the Surrogate-model assigned differential evolution for antenna synthesis (SADEA) algorithm presented in the article [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6612668). The [ooDACE toolbox](https://sumowiki.intec.ugent.be/index.php/OoDACE:ooDACE_toolbox) is used for the Gaussian regression alternative model.

This repository contains:

1. [The specification](spec.md) for how a standard README should look.
2. A link to [a linter](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme-preset) you can use to keep your README maintained ([work in progress](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/5)).
3. A link to [a generator](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme) you can use to create standard READMEs.
4. [A badge](#badge) to point to this spec.
5. [Examples of standard READMEs](example-readmes/) - such as this file you are reading.
